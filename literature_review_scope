The literature review for our project should do these three main things:
	1. Contextualise the problem - Airborne transmission in indoor environments.
	2. Explain the modelling approach - The classic and revised Wells-Riley models.
	3. Justify the technical and design choices - Why are we developing a web-app, why are we using Streamlit, etc.

Scope / What subjects to read into:

	1. Introduction to Airborne Disease Transmission Indoors
		• Mechanisms of transmission: Droplet nuclei, aerosols, IRPs.
		• Importance and impact: Case studies (e.g., measles, COVID-19), super-spreader events.
		• Environmental influences: Ventilation, humidity, temperature, room occupancy.

	2. Epidemiological Modelling of Airborne Infection
		• Basic models: SIR, SEIR, etc. - strengths and limitations.
		• Wells-Riley model: Origins (Riley et al., 1978), assumptions, mathematical formulation.
		• Use-cases: Past applications in real-world settings, particularly in indoor spaces (e.g., classrooms, offices).
	Key sources to consult:
		• Papers applying Wells-Riley in COVID-era building assessments.
		• Texts or papers comparing SEIR and Wells-Riley.

	3. Enhancements to Wells-Riley: Alexander Edwards (2024)
		• Motivations for enhancement: Why deterministic models fall short.
		• Overview of modifications: Randomness, heterogeneity in infectiousness/susceptibility, time-dependent effects.
		• Implications: More realistic simulations, especially for dynamic or small-population environments.
	This part should critically evaluate how each modification improves the models accuracy and potential computational challenges or assumptions introduced.
	
	4. Tools for Visualising Airborne Risk
		• Why tools are needed: Public engagement, policy-making, real-time assessments.
		• Examples of existing tools: WHO ARIA tool (scope, interface, limitations), SAMHE project (audience, use-case, interactivity).
		• Design considerations: What features make a tool credible, understandable, and useful?
	Key sources to consult:
		• Case studies of user-facing scientific apps.
	
	5. End-users
	Looking into end-users will help shape the UI, decide on the level of explanation required and what we should output.
	We need to define our user-groups: policymakers, school admins, clinicians, building managers, the general public?
	Analyse user-guides or feedback on similar tools and watch webinars or talks where real-world users speak about their needs or frustrations.

	6. Technologies for Building Analytical Web Applications
		• Overview of relevant frameworks: Libraries including Streamlit, Dash, Flask.
		• Why did we pick Streamlit?
		• Limitations and considerations.
	Key sources to consult:
		• Streamlit documentation and tutorials.
		• Papers or blogs detailing science app development.
	
	7. Gaps in Current Tools and Rationale for the App
		• Are current tools lacking adaptability, stochastic realism, or usability?
		• Why would implementing the revised model add value?
		• How does the tool position itself between academic modelling and public engagement?

When Searching for Papers, I Should Look into These Areas:

	• Indoor air quality and ventilation (building science, environmental engineering)
	• Infectious disease modelling (epidemiology, public health)
	• Stochastic modelling in epidemics (mathematical biology)
	• Digital public health tools (informatics, HCI)
	• Visualisation and usability in science apps (data science, UX for public health)


I should be targeting roughly between 18 to 24 high-quality papers.
Section	Target Papers
Indoor airborne transmission	4–6
Wells-Riley model (original + uses)	3–5
Edwards (2024) & stochastic extensions	2–3 (main + citations)
Tools like ARIA / SAMHE	3–4
Web-based analytical tools (general)	2–3
Streamlit / app-building techniques	2–3


Consensus AI is a good starting point, however it may miss very new, or very niche papers. It is also less effective when locating implementation details, like coding tools and app design choices.

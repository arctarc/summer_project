Chai Wang, 2021, Airborne Transmission of Respiratory Viruses.

Background and Motivation.

	• The traditional understanding of respiratory virus transmission was centred around and emphasised large droplets and fomite contact - large particles that quickly fall to the ground within two metres of release and objects/surfaces that carry infectious agents.
	• The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant limitations to this traditional way of thinking. Super-spreading events and the underlying patterns associated with indoor transmission could not be explained by the nature of droplets alone.
	• The author of this paper argues that airborne transmission is likely the dominant mode for several respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.

Key Advances in Understanding Airborne Transmission.

	1. Aerosol Generation and Characteristics.
		• The aerosols that we exhale are mostly smaller than five micrometres, in some cases they are even often smaller than a single micrometre, regardless of what activity you are performing to expel these aerosols.
		• Infectious particles are generated in a persons respiratory tract and come in an array of varying sizes.
		• Historically, any particle smaller than five micrometres would be considered as an aerosol, however this paper suggests that the appropriate cut-off point between a droplet and an aerosol should be 100 micrometres.
	2. Transport and Environmental Influences.
		• The movement of aerosols are influenced by many factors, these include humidity, temperature, UV light, ventilation, and the airflow/currents.
		• Aerosols can remain suspended in the air for hours and travel considerable distances beyond two metres.
		• Interestingly, the virus concentration in smaller aerosols is often higher, which makes these particularly infectious.
	3. Deposition in the Respiratory Tract.
		• Larger infector particles deposit themselves higher up in a persons airway.
		• Smaller particles, those that are smaller than five micrometres, can travel all the way down to the alveolar region. This means they have the potential to initiate the infection more effectively.
	4. Empirical Evidence Supporting Airborne Spread.
		• There are well-documented superspreading events, animal studies, airflow simulations and epidemiological patterns that provide support for the idea of aerosol transmission.
		• Wearing masks and physically distancing yourself from other people are only effective up to a certain point, especially in indoor and poorly ventilated settings.
		• The WHO and CDC in 2021 acknowledged that the inhalation of aerosols were a primary route for the spread of COVID-19.

Implications for Public Health.

	• Fomite and droplet transmission are not enough to, alone, explain the patterns of infection that we can observe.
	• Aerosols figurehead infection beyond the 2 micrometre mark, whilst droplets dominate infection at closer distances.
	• The existence of aerosols and airborne transmission presses us to rethink how respiratory viruses are both understood and then mitigated.

Recommendations and Outlook.

Public health strategies should be revaluated to emphasize:
	• Improve ventilation and airflow.
	• High-efficiency air filtration.
	• Use properly fitting masks.
	• UV disinfection.
It is becoming increasingly important to revaluate transmission routes so that we are properly prepared for the next pandemics.

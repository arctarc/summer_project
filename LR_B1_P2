Nogrady, 2024, WHO redefines airborne transmission: what does that mean for future pandemics?

Overview of WHO's Redefinition of Airborne Transmission.

The WHO has, as of this paper, formally updated their classification system for airborne transmission of pathogens, following extensive scientific consultation. This change in classification, which was released in April 2024, came two years after increasing criticism that the WHO was too slow to recognise that COVID-19 was primarily spread through the air, especially during the early stages of the pandemic.

Background: Delayed Acknowledgment of Airborne Spread.

	• Initially, the WHO guidance during the COVID-19  pandemic prioritised cleaning surfaces, washing your hands and distancing yourself from other - this guidance overlooked the dominant airborne route of transmission.
	• Despite the scientific evidence that was available in early 2020, the WHO only acknowledged airborne transmission publicly in late (October) 2020, and then amended their official documentation a year later, in December 2021!
	• Former WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan later admitted that they should have made this announcement earlier.
	• Some critics even argue that this delay had likely cost lives, since early intervention techniques lacked the use of mask wearing and improving ventilation.

The New WHO Technical Report (April 18, 2024).

Terminological Shift
	• Moves on from the traditional droplet/aerosol distinction, which was defined by a five micrometre cut-off point.
	• It instead introduces IRPs (infectious respiratory particles), which can be used as a universal term to described all pathogen-containing particles, irrespective of their size.

New Categorisation: "Through the Air"
	• This is a new blanket term that has been introduced to replace the term "airborne".
	• Two subcategories of "through the air" transmission were also created along with the introduction of the new umbrella term:
		○ Airborne transmission/inhalation: Infectious particles are inhaled into a persons respiratory tract.
		○ Direct deposition: Particles travel over a small distance before landing directly onto a persons mucous membrane (these include the mouth, nose, and eyes).
	• COVID-19 is primarily classified under airborne transmission/inhalation, with a minor risk from direct deposition.

Scientific and Practical Reception.

Praise.
	• Lidia Morawska (aerosol scientist): Accepted and welcomed the removal of the droplet/aerosol split, which misguided the response during the early stages of the pandemic.
	• Julian Tang (virologist): Praised the clarity that the report provided and believes it will aid faster, and more evidence-based, mitigation strategies during future pandemics.

Criticism and Debate.
	• Many experts still prefer the use of "airborne transmission" as it is more consistent with other forms of pathogen transmission, like waterborne.
	• However, some scientists argued against using the term "airborne", due to the term potentially causing panic among the public.

Implications for Public Health.

	• The new terminology, and framework that extended from it, are meant to act as the baseline for global understanding and future preparedness.
	• The WHO Chief Scientist Jeremy Farrar highlights that the brand-new classification allows us to recognise multiple transmission pathways in the future, making it practically flexible.
	• The report says that during future pandemics, public health interventions should concider:
		○ The type of transmission (airborne or direct deposition).
		○ Of course the severity of the disease.
		○ The amount of resources available (something to especially concider in low and middle income areas).

Forward-Looking Statements.

	• Experts, like Tang, believe that this brand-new framework will ensure that we will respond earlier and more appropriately during future pandemics by prioritising:
		○ Mask use.
		○ Ventilation.
		○ Non-pharmacological interventions.
Farrar adds that now we have revaluated the terminology that we use, we must now move onto revisiting the interventions techniques that we apply.

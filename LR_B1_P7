Pica, 2012, "Environmental factors affecting the transmission of respiratory viruses"

This paper looks to explore how environmental conditions influence the spread of respiratory viruses, in particular influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Airborne disease infections are widespread, causing much social and economic burden in their wake, unfortunately the exact mechanisms through which they spread vary greatly between viruses and still remain partially unsolved in some cases. To maintain consistency across this review, the paper uses the CDC's classification of transmission modes, which is made up of direct/indirect contact, droplet spray, and aerosols.

The authors highlight the diversity in transmission routes among respiratory viruses, for instance, RSV and other adenoviruses primarily spread through contact whilst viruses like influenza and SARS Coronavirus have significant airborne components. Viruses where the evidence is conflicting or insufficient includes rhinovirus and parainfluenza.

Temperature and humidity emerge as some of the major environmental influencers, especially for influenza. Animal studies, particularly those focusing on guinea pigs and mice, show that airborne disease transmission is greater in colder temperatures and when the relative humidity (RH) is lower. A key feature for us to concider is the affect that humidity has on the size of the droplet and viral stability - low RH results in smaller droplets that remain airborne for longer, enhancing their airborne transmission capabilities. However, it should be noted that aerosol viability does differ among various viruses; for example, RSV and some strains of influenza showcase a bimodal response to RH, while other viruses only remain stable under very specific conditions. It should be noted and taken into consideration, that absolute humidity (AH), which is the total content of water vapour in the air, has been found to be a stronger correlator to influenza spread when compared with RH, especially in more temperate climates. Although, in tropical regions, influenza transmission does not always necessarily follow this trend - sometimes transmission peaks during high-AH rainy seasons. This highlights that there are complex variations among different regions.

Precipitation has shown different associations with airborne transmission. Many studies that take place in tropical regions associate RSV hospitalisations with the number of rainy days rather than the total amount of rainfall. Some studies do confirm a positive correlation between rainfall and influenza or RSV infections, whilst others find no correlation or an inverse relationship. The differences in education that we find may be caused by geographical, methodological, and behavioural differences, such as population crowding during rainy periods.

Airflow and ventilation also influence airborne transmission, although fewer studies exist to support this idea. Animal experiments and observational studies in humans suggests that improved ventilation reduces viral spread by diluting the airborne particles. One notable case study is that during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens complex, where poor ventilation and airflow dynamics allowed airborne particles to travel across multiple buildings infecting people.

In conclusion, environmental factors like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and airflow undeniably impact airborne disease transmission, however their exact impact remains complex and sometimes contradictory. These factors likely interact with local behaviours, living conditions and the levels of immunity among the community. This paper calls for expanded surveillance.

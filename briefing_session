The Research Project is 60CP/180CP, so a third of our degree.
RSPP is a pass fail unit, you earn the credit points but it doesn't count towards the final classification.
	1. Conduct original, investigative research work.
	2. Become an expert in an advanced topic of scientific computing.
	3. Develop key transferable skills.

Over the summer, teaching hours will have finished, but, it should be treated as full-time, 600 hours of work, five days a week. That doesn’t mean non-stop work, but always thinking about it.
Should be able to work in the fishbowl and you should be on campus at least 2 days a week.

07/07 - In person poster session.
05/08 - Project end to write up.
18/08 - Presentation session.
29/08 - Final deadline and end of programme.
Write notes of your work for the report during this entire time.

Project report (and computing output) 80%
Poster 10%
Oral presentation 10%

Poster is combined with a poster session, where people will ask you questions.
You will only be assessed on the poster, so it should be self-explanatory.
Text should be concise and the poster should be visually appealing.
You can use PowerPoint and reshape. Turn it into a PDF, submit, and will be printed for us.
Think about; the flow, the amount of words, the images, how clear the topic is.

Structure of the report is essentially the same as the structure we've been working with.
Should be 30-55 pages, probably closer to 55 pages.

The abstract of a report should summarise the entire report. It should not use copy and pasted text from the report and it should be its own standalone element, not referencing the rest of the report, i.e. "As we will explain in the report…"
